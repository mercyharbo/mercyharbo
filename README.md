# Hi there ðŸ‘‹, I'm Code With Mercy

Hello, I am Mercy from Osun, Nigeria, a Software Developer & Designer passionate about creating amazing stuff for the internet. My interest started in 2018 when I met someone studying computer science at University like me that put me through how and where to start learning to code, after doing my won research I find out about W3school, udemy, and YouTube which helped my journey as I was just getting to know about HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the first time then.

I'm skilled in JavaScript, CSS, SCSS, React js, Node/express js, Git & Github, and I'm a team person, working together with people has helped me develop because I tend to learn and challenge myself to do more.

Over the years, I have learned to pick different projects beyond me just to improve my coding skill, which has really helped me. I pick projects from Frontendmentor, Dribble and more.

I'm an introvert that likes coding, soccer, music, dogs and cats, learning. I don't give up on anything no matter the result I am getting, always want results and never give up until I achieve that. I've stayed up all night debugging just because I don't want to leave the bug unfixed ðŸ˜‚
